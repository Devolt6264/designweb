    <h3>NAME:DEVOLT EDEM AMETORWU  PROGRAM:BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING YEAR:ONE
        The reason why i'm offering biomedical engineering is that:i really care about the life of patients and that i want to come up 
        with devices to save lives.Because it deals with designing better diasnotic tools for early disease detection and also
    helps to develop biocompatible materials for implants and drug delivery systems.I also like to work in the hospital to save human
lives.    </h3>
